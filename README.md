# Full stack Web and Desktop app development with Flask

## Introduction
I am teaching "Building Apps with Python" course to 1st year under-grad students pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.  One of the course outcome is to equip them with knowledge of creating a minimalist web app and a desktop app.  Being a micro web framework with built-in web server and with its capability to allow reuse of 99% of the codebase for creating a web app as well as desktop app (targeting both Windows and Mac), it is the ideal choice.
